## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines and agentic AI workflows in Python using LangChain and related tools. It contains three Jupyter notebooks that walk through:

- **RAG with Hugging Face & LangChain** (`enhance-llms-using-rag-and-hugging-face-k.ipynb`)  
- **Prompt Engineering & In-Context Templates** (`in-context-engineering-and-prompt-templates-k.ipynb`)  
- **LangChain Agent Patterns** (`langchain-agent-k.ipynb`)  

Additionally, a sample `companyPolicies.txt` file provides dummy corporate policies to load into a vector store.
